# 🚀 How to Rank in AI Answers (LLM SEO)

In the past, getting found on Google meant trying to be the **#1 link** for a search term, like "plumber in Springfield." Now, things are changing.

People are asking AI (like ChatGPT or Google's new search) questions, and the AI gives them **one complete answer**. Your new goal is to have **your business information** show up *inside* that answer, with a link back to your website.

This guide explains what that means, how to adjust, and the simple steps you can take this week to make your business the one AI trusts.

## ✨ What’s Changed? (And What It Means for You)

![What Are The New Changes](https://dlbvgkmykjuricmzvfat.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/red-engage/how-to-rank-in-ai-2.png)

Getting on Google used to be about getting your *website link* to the top of the list. This new way is about getting your *information* included in the answer AI writes.

Ideally, that AI answer will include a **link back to your site**, like a "source" credit.

This means you need to think a little differently. Instead of just writing one huge "Ultimate Guide" blog post, you need to make **clear, simple facts about your business** easy to find. You want to create **small, helpful pieces of information** that an AI can easily understand and use in its answer.

When people talk about **"AI SEO"**, they just mean making your website easy for AI to:

1.  **Find** when it's looking for answers.
2.  **Trust** and **link to** as the source for the information.

To do this, you just need to be clear about who you are, create easy-to-use facts, write in a simple way, and prove you're a real expert.

## 📜 Your Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Make It Crystal Clear Who You Are

If an AI can't tell the difference between you and your competitor, it might get confused or ignore you. Your first job is to make a perfect **"About Us" page**. This page *must* have your official business name, what you do, who you help, and the year you started.

Most importantly, link *from* this page to your official social media profiles (like LinkedIn or Facebook). This helps AI (and people) know they've found the *real* you.

* **Quick win:** On your "About Us" page, add a "Company Facts" box. Use 8-12 simple bullet points. Keep each line short and true (example: "Started in: 2020," "Services: Local Plumbing, 24/7 Repairs," "Service Area: Springfield County").

### 2. Create Small, Helpful Blocks of Information

![Helpful Content Blocks](https://dlbvgkmykjuricmzvfat.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/red-engage/how-to-rank-in-ai-3.png)

AI programs *love* finding neat, tidy blocks of text that directly answer a question. Think about creating your information in these simple formats:

* **Clear definitions** (explaining a term)
* **Question & Answer sections** (with simple questions and short answers)
* **Simple comparison tables**
* **Timelines** (like "Our Company History")
* **Step-by-step "how-to" guides**

When you write an article, put the main answer or definition right at the top, not buried at the end.

* **Quick win:** Add a **"Quick Summary"** or **"Main Point"** box at the very top of your posts. Also, add a **"Last Updated"** date at the bottom. AI often looks at the start and end of a page to find the most important info.

### 3. Put Your Facts in Simple Tables

This sounds more technical than it is. If you have product prices, different service plans, or lists of features, don't just write them in a long paragraph.

Put them in a **simple table** on your page with clear headings. Tables are very easy for AI to read and understand. This is much more helpful for both people and AI than a big wall of text.

* **Quick win:** Start a simple `/updates` or `/news` page. When you make a change, post a **dated, one-line update**. (Example: "Nov 12, 2025: Added new service plans"). This shows AI that your site is active and your information is fresh.

### 4. Make Your Site Easy to Read

Make sure the AI's "reading robots" can actually see your most important content. Keep your main pages (like "About Us" or "Pricing") simple and make sure they load fast. Don't hide your key information behind "click to reveal" buttons or annoying pop-ups that block the whole screen.

* **Quick win:** Make sure your most important pages (like "About Us" and "Services") are linked from your website's main menu. This makes them easy for everyone, including AI, to find.

### 5. Show You're a Real Expert

AI wants to know **who wrote something** and **who is a trusted expert**. Start using **author names** on your blog posts, along with their job title or a short bio. Publish your own small studies or helpful tips. Even a simple post about a trend you've noticed in *your* business is great. This gives AI something unique and original to use.

* **Quick win:** Add a short "How We Check Our Facts" note to your site's footer (the very bottom of the page). Briefly explain that you check your information for accuracy and try to keep it updated. This is a huge trust signal for both AI and human readers.

### 6. Update, Don't Delete

This is a big one. When your information changes (like your pricing), your first thought might be to just delete the old info. **Don't.** Someone, or an AI, may have already seen and saved that old fact.

Instead, **add a new, dated note** with the correction or update. This way, you create a clear history of your information.

* **Quick win:** Instead of just changing a price, add a small, dated line right above it: *“Note: As of November 2025, our pricing has been updated. See the new plans below.”*

## 📄 Simple Examples You Can Copy

* **'About Us' Facts Box:** "Started 2020; Independent; Offices in London; Services: A, B, C; We Help: Tech, Healthcare; Public contact: contact@red-engage.com."
* **Clear Definition:** Start your post with: "AI SEO is the process of making your content easy for artificial intelligence to find, understand, and link to." Then, add more detail below.
* **Helpful Q&A Section:** Use real questions. "How do I make my business clear to AI?" → "Start with a simple 'About Us' page listing your core services, location, and founding date."
* **Simple Comparison Table:** A two-column table with "Term" and "Plain Definition." Keep the sections short and to the point.
* **Simple Update Note:** "Nov 12, 2025 — Added pricing table; clarified service limits."

## ‼️ The Good and the Bad of This New Way

![The Good and the Bad](https://dlbvgkmykjuricmzvfat.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/red-engage/how-to-rank-in-ai-4.png)

✅ **The Good Stuff**

* Increases the chance your business's information appears *inside* AI answers.
* Builds long-term trust by proving you're a reliable source.
* Makes your website better for *humans* too, with clear, easy-to-read content.
* Creates reusable facts that partners or the press can easily use.

❌ **The Not-So-Good Stuff**

* This isn't a one-time fix. You have to keep your facts and tables up to date.
* You need to be consistent with your company name and your web page links.
* If your website is currently messy or disorganized, this will take some time to fix.
* Some website builders can make it tricky to add tables or other simple features.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

![Avoid These Common Mistakes](https://dlbvgkmykjuricmzvfat.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/red-engage/how-to-rank-in-ai-5.png)

* **A Vague "About Us" Page:** If your "About Us" page could describe five other companies, an AI won't know what makes you special. Be specific.
* **"Everything" Pages:** Avoid making one single page that tries to cover "everything about everything." An AI won't know what single fact to grab from it.
* **Changing Your Page Links:** When you change a page's web address (its link) or delete an old page, you break all the trust and links you've built.
* **Hiding Your Info:** If a human gets annoyed by a pop-up, an AI's reading-robot will be too. Keep your key info free and clear.
* **Using Only Marketing Talk:** AI trusts **facts, numbers, and dates** far more than claims like "We're the best!" or "We offer amazing solutions."

## ☑️ Bottom-line Checklist

You can do this. Start with one page and aim for steady progress, not perfection.

* [ ] **Clear 'About Us' Page:** Is it obvious who you are, what you do, and are your social media profiles linked?
* [ ] **Small Info Blocks:** Do your key pages have clear definitions, Q&A sections, or tables near the top?
* [ ] **Simple Tables:** Are your prices or features in a clean table, not just a paragraph?
* [ ] **Easy-to-Read Site:** Is your key info (like pricing) free of annoying pop-ups?
* [ ] **Show Your Expertise:** Do your articles have author names and "last updated" dates?
* [ ] **Dated Updates:** Do you have a simple log or page that shows your site is current?
