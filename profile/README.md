## What changed—and what “LLM SEO” means

![Graphic: LLM SEO Checklist](https://placehold.co/900x520 "A card-style checklist highlighting entity clarity, structured facts, provenance, distribution, freshness")

Traditional SEO favored documents and ranking signals. Answer engines favor **inclusion**: your facts showing up inside the response, ideally with a **citation**. That shift nudges your strategy from broad pages to **clear entities** and **liftable facts**.

**LLM SEO** is the practice of improving your odds of being:

1. **Retrieved** when a model gathers context, and
2. **Cited** when it composes the final answer.

You’ll prioritize: entity clarity, citable facts, structure-first content, transparent provenance, and smart distribution where models already look.

## A practical playbook (step-by-step)

### 1) Make your entity unmistakable

If a model can’t disambiguate you, it won’t cite you. Create a canonical **About** page with name, what you do, who you serve, founding year, leadership, and consistent brand naming across profiles. Link to your official social and repo homes so crawlers (and people) can confirm they’ve found the right you.

**Quick win:** Add a compact “Facts” block with 8–12 short bullet points about your company and services. Keep each line clear and verifiable.

### 2) Ship retrieval-friendly content blocks

Models love concise blocks they can lift: **definitions**, **FAQs**, **spec tables**, **timelines**, and **how-tos**. One concept per URL works better than a catch-all page. Put the definition up top, then the nuance.

**Quick win:** Add a **TL;DR** at the top and a **References & Last Updated** note at the bottom. Answers often pull from either end.

### 3) Expose important facts as data

Publish small **CSV/JSON** artifacts for specs, mappings, or benchmarks. Treat them like appendices to your articles. These artifacts are easy for crawlers and helpful for humans who need to reuse numbers.

**Quick win:** Launch a lightweight `/changelog` or `/press` page with **dated** micro-updates and anchors. Time-stamped deltas beat silent rewrites.

### 4) Be crawlable—and cite-able

Let legitimate crawlers in. Keep docs and reference pages simple, fast, and free of script gates. Clean sitemaps and canonicals still matter. Mirror your most important references in a public GitHub repo that points back to your domain.

**Quick win:** Add a plain README that lists your key reference URLs. Make it obvious where the “source of truth” lives.

### 5) Strengthen provenance and authority

![Flow: Crawl to Citation](https://placehold.co/1000x420 "Flow diagram: Robots → Sitemaps → Content Blocks → Facts/JSON → Changelog → Answer Citation")

Models look for **who said it first** and **who is trusted**. Use author bylines, credentials, and clear editorial standards. Publish small first-party findings—even a short study—with methods and dates. Earn contextually relevant citations rather than generic backlinks.

**Quick win:** Add a short “Editorial Standards” note covering sources used, how often you update, and who reviewed the piece.

### 6) Keep facts fresh—without erasing history

Don’t delete statements that others may have quoted. Add new entries with dates, corrections, and context. Preserve stable anchors so citations don’t break.

**Quick win:** Instead of “We updated pricing,” add a dated line with a permalink to the specific change.

## Examples you can copy

* **Entity facts block:** “Founded 2020; independent; offices in X; services A/B/C; industries served; typical engagement length; public repos; contact.” Short lines. Verifiable.
* **Definition up top:** “LLM SEO: improving your likelihood of retrieval and citation in AI-generated answers.” Then add detail below.
* **FAQ set that mirrors user phrasing:** Real questions, short answers. Example: “How do I make my service clear to AI?” → “Define it in one sentence, list inputs/outputs, add examples.”
* **Reference table:** A labeled two-column table: **Term** | **Plain definition**. Keep cells tight; models prefer concise entries.
* **Changelog snippet:** Date + one line + link to the section changed. Example: “2025-10-12 — Added pricing tiers table; clarified usage limits.”

## Pros & cons of the approach

**Pros**

* Increases the chance your facts appear **inside** AI answers.
* Builds durable trust via provenance and stable references.
* Improves human readability with structured, skimmable content.
* Creates reusable data surfaces (CSV/JSON) for partners and press.

**Cons**

* Requires ongoing care: definitions, tables, and changelogs must stay current.
* Demands discipline around naming, URLs, and versioning.
* Not a fast fix if your entity is unclear or inconsistently branded.
* Some platforms limit how much structure you can expose.

---

## Pitfalls to avoid

* **Vague positioning:** If your “About” page can describe five other companies, models won’t pin you down.
* **Mixed intents on one URL:** “Everything about everything” pages get lifted less.
* **Breaking links and anchors:** You wipe out your own citation history.
* **Walling off reference content:** Script-gated docs and interstitials block crawlers and frustrate readers.
* **Marketing-only claims:** Facts beat fluff. Provide dates, examples, and small datasets.
